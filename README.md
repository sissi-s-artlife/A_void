# Embracing Constraints in Language: A Tribute and Exploration

## Introduction

This project draws inspiration from Georges Perec's literary achievements, particularly his novel "La Disparition" ("A Void"). Perec's omission of the letter 'e' in his novel serves as a powerful linguistic constraint, symbolizing the silence surrounding the Holocaust. In this project, we'll explore constraints in language by creating a Python program that checks for the presence of the letter 'e' in a given text.

## Georges Perec and the Power of Constraints

Georges Perec was a member of the Oulipo group, a collective of writers who experimented with literary constraints. Omitting 'e' in "La Disparition" is a profound example of constraints conveying powerful messages. The absence of 'e' symbolizes the Holocaust's silence and serves as a tribute and linguistic balancing act.

## Connecting the Idea to a Python Project

To honor Perec's concept, we'll create a Python program that checks a text for the letter 'e'. This project lets us reflect on constraints' impact on meaning and expression, echoing Perec's powerful idea.

## Project Description

This project includes:
- A Python program prompting users for text input.
- A function to counts the 'e'.
- A display that shows the statistics of letter 'e' which was found in the text.
- A display that shows your text without the letter 'e' which reflects on how constraints influence language.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open `main.py` in `check_e` to view/run the Python program.
4. Follow program instructions to input text and observe results.

## Conclusion

This project pays homage to Perec's "A Void," exploring constraints' impact on language. Checking for 'e' in a text illustrates how small constraints shape perception of language. Just as Perec's constraint carried meaning, this project invites reflection on constraints' role in expression, understanding, and interpretation.

Reflect on the project's implications as you interact with our Python program.
